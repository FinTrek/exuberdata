# exuberdata

The goal of `exuberdata` is to provide critical values for the `exuber` package. 

### Datasets

* `radf_crit2`: Monte Carlo Critical Values for Recursive Augmented Dickey Fuller(`radf`) models

## Installation

Due to its large size `exuberdata` cannot be distributed as a conventional 
CRAN package. However, there are a couple of alternatives for installation.

First, through [drat](https://github.com/kvasilopoulos/drat)

```r
install.packages('exuberdata',repos = 'https://kvasilopoulos.github.io/drat/',type = 'source')

# Or, simularly through `exuber` wrapper function
install.packages("exuber")
exuber::install_exuberdata()
```

Finally, it can be installed through [github](https://github.com/kvasilopoulos/exuberdata).

```r
install.packages("remote")
remotes::install_github("exuberdata")
```
